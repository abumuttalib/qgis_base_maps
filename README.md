# qgis_base_maps

QGIS Base Maps is a mirror for Klas Karlsson qgis_basemaps.py script 

I created this repository since I faced some dificulty, in my opinion unnecessary, in finding the Klas Karlsson's (https://github.com/klakar) QGIS BaseMaps python script, qgis_basemaps.py, which in turn was expected to be pointing to the XYZ Tiles dataset, among others, created by Qiusheng Wu (https://github.com/giswqs)

Hope it helps the ones who may need it.
